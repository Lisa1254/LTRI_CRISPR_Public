# LTRI_CRISPR_Public


This repository is used to make accessible the final results of the private LTRI_CRISPR repository.  

The description from the invitation email is as follows:  
>Regarding the small assignment, I would like you to analyze a set of CRISPR screens we undertook.  
>The file in this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/75mm5xgqf7x5w4s/Test_readcount.txt?dl=0) represents readcounts of screens done with the [TKOv3 library](https://www.addgene.org/pooled-library/moffat-crispr-knockout-tkov3/)  
>For the sake of simplicity we are not providing the fastq files but if you require them, do let me know.  
>  
>The screens are done in duplicate and I would like you to generate gene-level scores either using [MaGeCK](https://sourceforge.net/p/mageck/wiki/Home/), [DrugZ](https://github.com/hart-lab/drugz), or any other CRISPR screen analysis tools that compare untreated vs drug-treated (cisplatin, KBrO3, â€¦) conditions. I would like you send me the results in a tabular format along with a concise visualization of the results. Feel free to look at the data and if you gather any other insight, I would be happy to hear about those as well. I would like you to send me the results of your analysis me before Monday at noon ET.
